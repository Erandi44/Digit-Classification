# Digit Classification Using Machine Learning

This notebook demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict which digit (0â€“9) appears in an image based on pixel values from a labeled dataset.

We begin by exploring the dataset, preprocessing the data, and applying multiple classification models including:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- Neural Networks - MLP

Each model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.
